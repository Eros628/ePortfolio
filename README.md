# ePortfolio Documentation by Eros Lucagbo

## Description

This ePortfolio showcases several of my projects, demonstrating my skills and experience in programming and web development. The portfolio is designed with a clean and simple layout that is easy to navigate. It includes a navigation bar and menu for smooth browsing.
The website also includes interactive elements and animations to enhance the user experience, all built with modern web development technologies.

**The projects featured are:**

1. **Short Hair with Glasses Detector**: A machine learning model to detect people with short hair and glasses. Using OpenCV library for object detection and Yolov4 to train the model.
2. **Visual Novel Game**:A psychological horror visual novel titled Beneath the Vines, developed using the Ren'Py game engine.
3. **Weather Fetcher using API**: a website that fetches and displays weather data of a certain city using TCP sockets and OpenWeather API.
4. **Sales and Inventory Management System**: A system that helps manage The BikeShop sales and inventory, using laravel and Mysql.

_(These projects are available in my GitHub repository. Feel free to check them out!)_

git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio.git
```

### 2. Setting Up the Development Environment
Ensure that you have a code editor like Visual Studio Code installed.
No special backend setup is required for this portfolio, as it is static with client-side technologies.

### 3. Running the Portfolio Locally
Open the folder containing the project files in your code editor.
To view the portfolio locally, simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser.


### 4. Contributing:
If you want to contribute, fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes. 
Ensure your code is well-documented and follows best practices for web development.

### 5. Forms
The form is handled using Formspree, which allows you to easily collect form submissions without needing server-side code. 
Set up an account on Formspree and configure the form endpoint if needed.
