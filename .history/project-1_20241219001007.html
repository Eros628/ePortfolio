                This project, developed during my first year in collaboration with my partner, Andrew Bautro, focuses on detecting individuals with short hair wearing glasses using advanced computer vision techniques. 
                We implemented the system using C++ and integrated it with the OpenCV library for image processing. The detection model is based on YOLOv4, chosen for its high speed and accuracy in object detection tasks.
                To prepare the system, we annotated a dataset of 5,000 images using Roboflow, ensuring precise labeling of short hair and glasses. The annotated dataset was then used to train the YOLOv4 model, achieving reliable performance in detecting the targeted features. 
                Once the model was trained, it was integrated into the application to enable real-time detection. The system also provides flexibility for users, allowing them to choose between uploading an image file or using their camera for live detection.
                This project demonstrates the effectiveness of YOLOv4 and the importance of thorough dataset preparation in achieving accurate detection results. The system serves as a strong foundation for exploring more complex computer vision tasks in the future
